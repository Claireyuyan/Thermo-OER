# 1.5 Quality of a Vapor Mixture

## Problem Statement:
In a vapor mixture at 150Â°C, the mass of the vapor phase is 3 kg, and the total mass of the mixture is 5 kg. 
Determine the quality of the mixture.

```{code-cell} ipython3
## Solution:

# Given values
m_vapor = 3  # Mass of vapor phase in kg
m_total = 5  # Total mass of the mixture in kg

# Quality calculation
x = m_vapor / m_total

# Output the result
print(f"Quality of the mixture: {x}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
