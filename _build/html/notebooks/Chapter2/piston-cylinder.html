<h2>Problem statement:<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-statement" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A piston–cylinder device contains 0.9 kg of steam at 300°C and 0.8 MPa. Steam is cooled at constant pressure until one-third of the mass condenses.
(a) Show the process on a T-v diagram and a P-v diagram
(b) Find the final temperature.
(c) Determine the volume change</p>
